    Part D. Business Marketing Thought Question
    
    Based on the plot and the information from the PDF, I would reccomend a 
    target weight of about 2.8 - 3. Although the correlation implies that
    game ratings tend to increase with weight, which would increase sales,
    it appears that the maximally-fun games are somewhere between 1.5 and 3.2
    in weight. If I'm a "head of marketing for a boardgame company wishing to
    break into the solo board gaming arena", I would want to trust the team
    making the game, and tell them to make a game of about that difficulty. Of
    note is the fact that there exists a game in the mid 3s in terms of weight,
    which no higher-weighted game is able to surpass in rating. I'd like to
    think that the team at my company would make that type of game!
